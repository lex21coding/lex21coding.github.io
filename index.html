                            I would say I'm and extrovert, but only once I know people<br>
                            I'm a complete nerd for:

                                <li>history (specially Roman and Greek history)</li>

                            I really enjoy philosophy<br>

                        <p>
                            I'm studying Data Science (currently in my third and last year) at ISCTE in Lisbon<br>
                            I know how to speak Portuguese and English like a native and a bit of French<br>

                    <h4>Work wise:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Everyone loves to say they are hard workers (and I do too...)<br>
                            I'm a good problem solver and enjoy working with other people<br>
                            I'm used to work in Python and R, but I also have base knowledge SQL and HTML<br>
